/*
 General Rules:
 
    1. Properties goes first.
    2. Class methods are next.
    3. Instance methods are in the end.
 
    ?>  1. CLASS METHODS
        2. INSTANCE METHODS
        3. CLASS PROPERTIES (*)
        4. PROPERTIES
 
    >   Class methods have superior position over instance's methods/properties and
        it makes sense to declare them first.
        But then it becomes not handy to split class and instance's methods by properties
        declaration, as often inits and static 'factory' methods have the same semantics
        and must be edited together.
 
        (*) Logically it's more appropriate to place them at #2, but it leads to splitting
            +/- methods. Anyway having class properties is rather an exception.
